  idef1x/mail-owncloud-docker
```
# Optional environment vars to use:
```
- SQLUSR  => mysql admin user (default admin)
- SQLPWD  => mysql user password (default random generated -> see logs for the password (docker logs <container ID>|grep password)
- SQLHOST => in case you use an external mysql server (default localhost)
- SQLDB   => in case you use an extern mysql server (default mail for mail and owncloud for owncloud)
             NB: only supply de datbase for mail, since owncloud will ask for it during setup.
- WEB     => if set then no SSL wil be activated (in case you use a SSL proxy or other reason why you don't want SSL)
```
# Postfixadmin
```
- First setup goto http(s)://hostname/postfixadmin/setup.php to initialize database
- setup an setup password and copy paste the red $CONF string into /var/www/postfixadmin/config.local.php (before the last ?>):
  - open een shell in the container: docker exec -it <container ID> bash
  - edit file (vi)
  - save and exit shell
- Then goto http(s)://hostname/postfixadmin to configure domains and mailboxes etc
```
# Owncloud
```
- goto http(s)://hostname 
- fill in a username/password for an admin user
- select mysql database (or sqlite if you don't care about performance)
- use the given (by your external mysql manager) sql credentials or the autogenerated ones (see environment vars)
- choose the supplied database name or invent you own (example: owncloud)
- choose the supplied external mysql server or choose 127.0.0.1 for local 

- NB: sometimes owncloud wines about not able to connect to sql server (if localhost/127.0.0.1). Most times a second try will work.
      Putting 127.0.0.1 in the host field (instead of localhost) seems to work better than localhost. For now I don't know what's picky. 
```
# Webmail
```
- you can use the mail client provided by (installable via) owncloud 
  - fill in details and select SSL/TLS as IMAP/SMTP security 
  - Use 127.0.0.1 as IMAP and SMTP host 
```
# To use own certificates:
```
- For Apache certificates add parameters:
  for cert: -v <path to SSL cert>:/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
  for key : -v <path to SSL key>:/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key

- For dovecot/postfix certificates add parameters:
  for cert: -v <path to SSL cert>:/etc/dovecot/dovecot.pem
  for key : -v <path to SSL cert>:/etc/dovecot/private/dovecot.pem
```

# Logging
- all logging is now sent to a syslog server on the dockerhost
