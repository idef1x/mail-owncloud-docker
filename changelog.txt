Changelogs will go here in case it's not suitable to put in the README.md

date:
20170731:	postfixadmin and owncloud issue fixed
20160902:	updated to ubuntu 16.04 and owncloud 9.1.0
20160117:	updated for owncloud to install v8.2.2
20151230: 	nothing changed actually, but somehow the automatic build on the Docker hub failed due to 
        	postfixadmin downloaded incorrectly. It failed locally once as well, but then it 
		went oke again, so there's nothing wrong with the build file :)
		So this changelog was added to make a note off that.
